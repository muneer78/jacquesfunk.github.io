I'm interested in a lot of different things. Please see below for a links.

[The Notebook](http://muneer78.github.io/notebook.html): A place for my loose thoughts and ruminations.

[Ted Cruz's College Days](http://muneer78.github.io/cruz.html): The guy is a cartoon supervillain, and stories from his college days make him seem even more unlikeable than he is now.
