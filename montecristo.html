<h1><a id="Count_of_Monte_Cristo_2"></a>Count of Monte Cristo</h1>
<p>I’m stealing this idea from James Clear. I want to begin reviewing books so that I can actually remember what I liked about them and any insights they provided to me.</p>
<p>The Book in 3 Sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>One can overcome misfortunes caused by one’s enemies by listening to the right mentors.</li>
<li>Play the long game when putting your plans into action.</li>
<li>You have to preserve your humanity and consider how your actions may affect innocent parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary: this includes quotes only this time. I’ll put in personal notes for future books.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Alas, my boy,” said he, “human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits; and when I have taught you mathematics, physics, history, and the three or four modern languages with which I am acquainted, you will know as much as I do myself. Now, it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning I possess.”
“Two years!” exclaimed Dantes; “do you really believe I can acquire all these things in so short a time?”</li>
<li>“Not their application, certainly, but their principles you may; to learn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned. Memory makes the one, philosophy the other.”</li>
<li>“For all evils there are two remedies – time and silence.”
“It is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black cloud. The soul forms its own horizons; your soul is darkened, and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising”</li>
<li>It’s necessary to have wished for death in order to know how good it is to live.”</li>
<li>“All human wisdom is contained in these two words – Wait and Hope”</li>
</ul>
